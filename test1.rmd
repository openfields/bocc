# Overview

To characterize the response of bird communities in the post-breeding and migration period, we will fit occupancy models to data collected in 2017 and 2018.  This document provides an overview of the data analysis through a few stages: a simple occupancy model, an occupancy model with covariates on the ecological process, and an occupancy model with covariates on the ecological process and random effects on the observation process.  

# A Simple Occupancy Model



Ecological Process: _z_~_i_~ ~ Bernoulli($\psi$)
Observation Process: _y~_i,j_~_ ~ | _z_~_i_~ ~ Bernoulli(_z~i~p_)
